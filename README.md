# Personal Webiste Host


The Website: [https://yetao.netlify.app/](https://yetao.netlify.app/) is deployed on [Netlify App](https://app.netlify.com/teams/jansonboss/overview)

After change content in [index.md](http://index.md) you can push to remote repository and the [netify.app](http://netify.app) website will help for delpoying automatically which is pretty convenient :)

Notice that I use jekyll for website creation but I found there's issue using this framework and depoly on the github. So in the end I switch to netify and everything works fine.
