# About Me

Master student at **[Data Science Program of USF]**, and will be graduating this coming Agust, 2021. My interests include Statistics, Data Analysis and Finance, Recently, I've found a great passion for Data Science and Machine Learning, and will devote myself to exploitation in this area. Also I am a semi-professional GO player with 4 Dan certification.

In addition, I'm currently working as a Data Scientist intern at **[LexisNexis]**, mainly focus on natural language processing in the Legal domain.
With my strong modeling, and NLP skills, I have been successfully finished several projects, and one of them is currently being in the production phrase, and will be released as an API for interal usgae very soon :) 

This website basically serves as a playground for me to share some of my study and projects in a more accessible manner and explore the use of data to communicate ideas. I used to code predominantly in R but now primarily in Python.
