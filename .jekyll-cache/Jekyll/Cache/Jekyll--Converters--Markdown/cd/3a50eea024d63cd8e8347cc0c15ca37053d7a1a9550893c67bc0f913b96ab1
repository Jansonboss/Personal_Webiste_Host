<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>In this project, I construct a data pipeline which intakes raw <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.wav</code> files, and
then uses machine learning to predict the genre of the track. We first do a
frequency-space transformation (similar to the Fourier transform), and then do
randomized dimension reduction on the resulting array. Finally, we put the
dimension-reduced signal through a naive Bayes classifier, which we train on
about 500 sample tracks.</p>

<p>Below is the confusion matrix for the resulting classifier. As one might expect,
classical is pretty easy; jazz is hard. A more thorough discussion of the
algorithm and results, including additional (less successful) approaches, can be
found below.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>A few years ago I designed a machine learning algorithm which performs automatic
genre classification of musical signals. The basic idea is that if the genre of
a piece of music has certain acoustic signatures, then a computer should be able
to pick up on those. However, teasing out those signatures requires some signal
processing know-how, along with some knowledge of data preprocessing and
classification methodologies from the machine learning domain.</p>

<p>We consider five genres: classical, jazz/blues, electronic, metal/punk, and
rock/pop. This taxonomy is far from exhaustive, but is a good starting point,
with genres that are for the most part quite acoustically distinct. Our most
efficient model classifies with 80% accuracy. Those interested can read
<a href="/assets/docs/genre_classification.pdf">the full write-up</a> of the project; here I’ll go through the big ideas and
leave out the details.</p>

<h2 id="preprocessing">Preprocessing</h2>

<p>We begin with a raw <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.wav</code> file, which is an uncompressed format for storing
audio signals.<sup id="fnref:fnote1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fnote1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> We then remove the beginning and end of the track, as
songs often start and end with indiosyncratic structures that are not indicative
of the genre.</p>

<p>Next, we perform a spectral decomposition. This means we decompose the signal
into its frequency components. When you look at the display on an equalizer and
see the signal bars at different frequencies, you are looking at a spectral
decomposition.</p>

<p>The most common spectral decomposition in mathematics and physics is the Fourier
Transform. However, the Fourier Transform does not efficiently represent how the
human ear hears sound; we hear frequencies on a <strong>logarithmic</strong> scale, meaning
that if notes are one octave apart, then the frequency of the second is twice
the frequency of the first.<sup id="fnref:fnote2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fnote2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> To mitigate this issue, we use the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum">mel-frequency cepstrum</a>, which is naturally logarithmically scaled. We now
have a frequency decomposition, which we expect to be useful in analyzing sound;
for example, we expect classical music to have lower signal at the bass
frequencies compared to electronic music.</p>

<p>After obtaining the time-varying mel-frequency cepstrum components (MFCCs), we
have a time series of about 1000 points, with each point having 30
coefficients. Said another way, our musical track now lives in a 30,000
dimensional space. We are thus up against the ubiquitous problem of machine
learning, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality">curse of dimensionality</a>.</p>

<h2 id="dimensionality-reduction">Dimensionality Reduction</h2>

<p>The mathematics surrounding the analysis of high-dimensional data is rich and
fascinating. One remarkable result is that you can perform entirely random (!)
projections, reducing the dimensionality by orders of magnitude, and still
retain most of the information present in the data. This result is known to
mathematicians as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson-Lindenstrauss_lemma">Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma</a>.</p>

<p>The beauty of this result is twofold. The geometry and analysis behind it are
surprising, yet intuitive once grasped; also, it immediately provides us with a
dimensionality-reduction algorithm which is computationally efficient and
trivial to implement.<sup id="fnref:fnote4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fnote4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>There are, of course, other more sophisticated approaches to the problem of
dimensionality reduction. The ubiquitous principal component analysis (PCA) is a
projection method, but it selects the projections based on their explanatory
power. The Johnson Lindenstrauss lemma is telling us, essentially, that when our
data is high dimensional we don’t need to worry about which direction we choose;
all directions, with high probability, will contain most of the signal
present in the data.<sup id="fnref:fnote3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fnote3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="graph-representations">Graph Representations</h2>

<p>As a more high-falutin alternative to random projections, we explore
dimensionality methods based on graph embeddings. A <strong>graph</strong> (also called a
<strong>network</strong>) is a collection of objects and their connections. The details of
this approach become quite technical, so this presentation will be qualitative
rather than quantitative.</p>

<p>Recall that, for each track, we now have a time series of points in
30-dimensional space, or equivalent 30 time series in one dimensional
space). Each dimension represents a frequency band. We build a graph by
considering interactions between these bands;<sup id="fnref:fnote5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fnote5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> does the intensity of the
low frequencies tend to move with the intensity of high frequencies? Or, are
their intensity profiles independent?</p>

<p>So, for each possible pair of our 30 frequency bands (435 possible pairs in
total), we have a pairwise term indicating the interaction strength. We then
perform a final embedding which reduces our graph into a vector in 30
dimensions. This embedding is based on the eigenvalues of the matrix
represntation of the graph, and a description of it is beyond the scope of this
article; suffice to say, it is the same technique that lies at the heart of
Google’s PageRank algorithm, and is a well-tested method for graph embedding.</p>

<h2 id="classification">Classification</h2>

<p>We now have two competing models, both of which result in data of a reasonable
dimension (30 dimensions vs 30,000). But we still face the task of classifying
these data points into groups. In our case, since we will train our model on
labelled training data, we are looking at a <strong>supervised learning</strong> scenario.</p>

<p>We compare the efficacy of two approaches: a naive Bayes classifier, and a
support-vector classifier. The first is a linear model, so it does not consider
pairwise interation terms between data features (i.e. the dimensions of our data
points). This simplicity makes the model computationally efficient and highly
interpretable, but for some data the interaction terms are very important, and a
model such as naive Bayes will not have optimal performance.</p>

<p>The support-vector machine approach is more computationally intensive than that
of naive Bayes. However, it is able to model arbitrary interactions between data
features, depending on the kernel chosen. We use a radial basis function (RBF)
kernel, which models nonlinear interactions in a localised way, and is known to
be effective in a variety of settings.<sup id="fnref:fnote6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fnote6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>Below are accuracy plots and confusion matrices for both the random projection
and graph embedding techniques.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/rand_confusion.png" width="50%" hspace="20" align="left" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/rand_accuracy.png" width="50%" hspace="20" align="left" /></p>

<p>The first pair of charts are for the randomized projection model. Based on what
we see, we recommend using a Naive Bayes classifier with \(\approx 10^3\)
dimensions. This is the optimal balance of performance and computational
efficiency, obtaining 98% performance relative to the problem without any
dimensionality reduction. Interestingly, the support vector classifier
underperforms Naive Bayes, indicating that the interaction terms between
features contain more noise than signal.</p>

<p>Things are quite different when we use graph embedding as our dimensionality
reduction method. In this case, there is in fact an optimal number of
dimensions, and increasing beyond this optimal dimensionality has a significant
detrimental effect on performance. This is to be expected, as our spectral
embedding method naturally chooses the more informative dimensions first, and
later features have a lower signal to noise ratio.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/graph_accuracy.png" width="50%" hspace="20" align="right" /></p>

<p>When using graph embedding, the support vector classifier outperforms the naive
Bayes classifier, indicating that interaction terms in our spectral embedding
are much more informative than they are in our random projection. Again, this
implies that the structural information in the spectral embedding is both
front-loaded and has complicated interdependence structure, whereas the random
projection method generates mostly independent features which are, on average,
of equal importance.</p>

<p>In both scenarios, we see that the easiest genre to classify is classical, and
the hardest is jazz/blues. This is what we would expect, since classical has a
distinct acoustic signature (i.e. instrumentation), while jazz/blues is highly
variable, and such a wide variety of training data will not produce an accurate
classifier.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The key takeaway from this project is that <strong>simple methods often work very
well</strong>. The optimal approach relied on the simpler dimensionality reduction
technique (random projections) and the simpler classifier (naive Bayes). This
simplicity gives the added benefit of computational efficiency and model
interpretability.</p>

      <p>Most common compression methods, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.mp3</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.aac</code>, rely on
decomposing the signal into its frequency components, and removing the high
frequency components, which are primarily noise and/or inaudible to the
human ear. We’ll end up doing a frequency decomposition of our own later on,
