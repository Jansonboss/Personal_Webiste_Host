<p><em>(Code for this project is available on <a href="https://github.com/peterewills/primary-school">GitHub</a>.)</em></p>

<p>This project looks at ways to automatically detect important changes in social
networks. We use a dataset collected in a <a href="http://www.sociopatterns.org/datasets/primary-school-temporal-network-data/">French primary school</a>; RFID tags were
used to map face-to-face contact bewtween students. This give us a social
network that changes over minutes, rather than the weeks or years it takes to
see significant change in online social networks.</p>

<h2 id="the-data">The Data</h2>

<p>As we can see below, the graph changes significantly over time. There are three
distinct phases. In class, the students mostly remain in clusters (the circles
represent individual classrooms). During recess, the class groups hold together
somewhat, but there is much contact between the classes. In lunch, the classroom
communities almost entirely dissolve, leaving us with a graph that looks almost
entirely random.</p>

<h2 id="the-approach">The Approach</h2>

<p>Turns out that a very good way to compare the graphs is to treat each edge as a
1\(\Omega\) resistor, and measure the resistance between vertices. Comparison
of this resistance structure <em>between</em> graphs then quantifies how similar or
dissimilar they are in their overall structure.</p>

<p>The results of this comparison can be seen below. The resistance distance does a
remarkably good job of detecting important structural changes in the graph, and
signals the structural transitions between class, lunch and recess.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re hungry for more theoretical analysis of the resistance distance, see
my paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07362">on the arXiv</a>.</p>
